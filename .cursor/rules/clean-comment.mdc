description: |
  Do NOT explain code changes in comments, such as "added xxx" or "removed xxx because xxx".
  Do NOT add conversation-specific explanations, notes, or meta commentary.
  Only describe the functionality of the final code.
  Keep comments concise and only add them for complex or non-obvious logic.
  Do not use comments to delete code; directly remove the code without adding explanations about what was deleted.
