description: Rules for updating markdown documentation files

When updating documentation files:

1. Read the entire document first to understand its structure, sections, and flow
2. Find the most appropriate location to integrate new content based on:
   - Logical relationship with existing sections
   - Document flow and narrative
   - Where readers would naturally expect to find the information
3. Integrate new content naturally into existing sections when possible:
   - Add as a paragraph within a relevant section
   - Extend an existing list or table
   - Add as a subsection under an appropriate parent section
   - Distribute across multiple sections if a feature affects different parts of the document
4. Do NOT simply create a new top-level section and place all new content there
5. Only create a new section if the topic is truly distinct from all existing content
